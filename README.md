Over recent years, as the popularity of mobile phone devices has increased, SMS has grown into
a multi-million dollars industry. Which resulted in unsolicitated commercial advertisements
(spams) being sent to mobile devices. In parts of Asia, up to 30% of text messages were spam 
in 2012. 
In this project, a database from Kaggle and IIT Dehli is used, and after preprocessing and 
feature extraction, different machine learning algorithm are applied to the database.
