# Sms-Spam-Classifier
Over recent years, as the popularity of mobile phone devices has increased, SMS has grown into
a multi-million dollars industry. Which resulted in unsolicitated commercial advertisements
(spams) being sent to mobile devices. In parts of Asia, up to 30% of text messages were spam 
in 2012. 
In this project, a database from Kaggle and IIT Dehli is used, and after preprocessing and 
feature extraction, different machine learning algorithm are applied to the database.

```print("Work still in progress to introduce better result from current models")```

### Briefs of file
-```spams.csv``` Dataset file in the preferred .csv format with IIT Delhi dataset being mergerd with.
-```formatted_set.py``` To format the code into the required .csv and into particular columns.
-```preprocessing.py``` Minmalistic code required for preprocessing, feature extraction which is to be performed on the dataset.
-```README.md``` You are reading it now ;-)
